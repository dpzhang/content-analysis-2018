Invited at the last minute to house sit for the wealthy Poe's, Dorothy Pritchard figured she'd have a Halloween night like no other: She'd get to collect a healthy paycheck, watch campy horror films, and suck face with her sexy boyfriend. Yet, not everything is as it initially seems as the Poe's soon introduce her to the woman she'll also be babysitting. That woman happens to be the Poe's rotting, comatose mother living in the upstairs bedroom. Mother is a macabre sight to behold as she is surrounded by the child like obsessions of her life, from dolls, harlequin clowns, music boxes, religious iconography, and more. All are given the most love and attention a comatose woman can give them, and suddenly Dorothy's night isn't quite turning out as she expected it to. As the Poe's leave for the party at the Governor's mansion, Dorothy's night takes a turn for the worse as her hot boyfriend dumps her coldly, possibly realizing they were never really dating in the first place. It also doesn't help that the campy horror flick she chose to watch is worse than she hoped. Left alone in the dark, gargantuan mansion, Dorothy finds solace in the Dicken's classic 'A Christmas Carol'... and soon finds that perhaps reading an old standby when a comatose woman is 'living' upstairs isn't necessarily the best idea in the world. As Halloween night grows deeper, and the approaching storm begins to rage, the nightmare begins as Dorothy is haunted by a personage that at first appears innocent, but turns into a horrifying monster of decay and blood. Building to a crescendo, Dorothy struggles to grapple with reality as the ghostly being descends upon her. Yet, this is just the first of Dorothy's troubles as the inanimate objects of Mother's room begin to take life, and the harlequin clown stalks her through the dark of the mansion. With seemingly nowhere to run, Dorothy must suck it up in order to pass the test of the very real, and very alive clown doll. But, Dorothy's night isn't finished as she must face off against the one who is seemingly behind the hellish freak show on display. The one who is the living dead herself, and must be defeated in order to free Dorothy from the nightmare that has ensued. However, Dorothy Pritchard will wish she never went up against the decaying flesh in the upstairs bedroom, as the comatose mother will prove that even when she's almost dead, there's still life those old bones yet."

Together they found a cast and crew of friends and colleagues, all of whom shared a collective love of Nolan and Ledger's dark and brutal portrayal of the Joker. With a budget next to nothing, the biggest obstacle the team faced was finding a location. By chance, Casey was able to procure a 35,000 sq. ft. warehouse that was not only ideal, but at no cost thanks to ATB Studios. Zilla Lighting generously donated use of all their lighting & grip equipment and the RED camera was lent out by a close friend of Rodner and Schendel's. Tell Gordon Hello grew from a scene that was to be shot in a dark garage on HD to a piece of real production value shot on the RED in a legitimate warehouse. It quickly became apparent to all involved that Tell Gordon Hello would not be just an ordinary short film.
